### Good evening ðŸ‘‹ I'm just a guy who know about coding a little late in life, so to make up for it I'm gonna code until I'm 80 or something
## Something about me
- I don't like blue light, you probably see me using a yellowish screen since it help me focus on the docs for a much longer time.
- I'm much smarter than I was in my 20, the younger me would actually struggle to code or reading docs.
- Most of my vocabulary on programming are in English, so I get a little mismatch to my Vietnamese peers
## Language I prefer
- Javascript, for the sheer amount of things I can create with that.
- Seriously, the amount of thing to create from Js is kinda insane to me. I build a chess app, a server, an excell script, and they make me some good money. Apparently I can train AI with it too.
- Maybe someday when I was unemployed, I'd spend sometime learning about Google Tensor Flow, but rightnow I have tons of stuff to learn about coding in an enterprise enviroment.
